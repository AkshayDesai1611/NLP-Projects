History and relationships to other fields [edit] See also:  Timeline of machine learning  The term  machine learning  was coined in      by  Arthur Samuel  an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of  computer gaming  and artificial intelligence . The synonym  self-teaching computers  was also used in this time period. By the early     s an experimental \"learning machine\" with  punched tape  memory called Cybertron had been developed by  Raytheon Company  to analyze  sonar  signals electrocardiograms and speech patterns using rudimentary  reinforcement learning . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \" goof\" button to cause it to re -evaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the     s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the     s as described by Duda and Hart in     . In       a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a  neural network  learns to recognize    characters (   letters    digits and   special symbols) from a computer te rminal. Tom M. Mitchell  provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience  E with respect to some class of tasks  T and performance measure  P if its performance at tasks in  T as measured by  P improves with experience  E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally  operational definition  rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows  Alan Turing \\'s proposal in his paper \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence \" in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the que stion \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". Modern -day machine learning has two objectives one is to classify data based on models which have been dev eloped the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancero us moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.  '"
